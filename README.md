# polyglot_ast
Rust implementation of a polyglot (cross-language) Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) framework.

This repository contains tools to build polyglot ASTs from source code of GraalVM applications. 
It currently partially supports python and javascript, and is built in a manner that aims to facilitate addition of new languages.

There is no Rust crate for this project (yet).
